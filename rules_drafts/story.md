# Story System


## Basics

You have a certain group of locations available to you. Locations offer certain types of encounters, sometimes with a modifier. Locations are used up by the encounters you take at them.


## Encounters

The core of the story system is encounters. There are many types of encounters:

- Tracking  
  finding things
- Informant  
  getting information
- Negotiation  
  convincing people
- Valor  
  combat, generally
- Skullduggery  
  roguish, underhanded things
- Favor  
  getting people to do things for you
- Piety  
  getting help from the gods
- Preparation  
  getting things in order
- Adventure  
  a special type of long-form, typically combat-based series of encounters



## Locations

There should also be a bunch of locations. Here's an incomplete list:

- The Inn (informant, negotiation, skullduggery)
- The Arena (valor, skullduggery, preparation)
- The Woods (tracking, valor, skullduggery)
- The Court (favor, valor, negotiation)
- The Village (preparation, tracking, informant)
- The Barracks (valor, favor, negotiation)
- The Waterfront (informant, skullduggery, negotiation)
- Merchant Quarter (preparation, informant, favor)
- Temple Quarter (piety, negotiation, favor)
- Noble Quarter (favor, valor, skullduggery)
- The Frontier (tracking, valor, negotiation)
- The Mountain (tracking, piety, preparation)
- The Library (tracking, informant, favor)

These should become more specific, especially as the setting gets narrowed down. (I'm thinking there's a specific city and its hinterland.)

Some of these locations would also have boosts, like you can do a little better on piety encounters if they're in the Temple Quarter.


## Quests

Finally, there are quests. A game session is centered around a quest, and quests have various requirements, which are paid up in encounters. Quests have phases, and often the phases can be completed in several ways.

So, an example:

Find the Lost Tome of Krakenwald  
- Phase 1: find the location
    - 2 Tracking, or
    - 2 Informant
- Phase 2: negotiate entry
    - 2 Negotiation, or
    - 1 Favor and 1 Preparation, or
    - 2 Skullduggery
- Phase 3: retrieve the tome
    - Adventure

Nearly all quests should include an adventure at some point (if they don't, they should have some very special rule to compensate).

Quests have specified rewards.


## Adventures

Most encounters are essentially a single thing (occasionally, they can be sub-quests, which opens an entirely different path).

Adventures are different. Instead of being tied to locations, they are tied to quests. No location will give you an adventure.

When you go on an adventure, you draw from the adventure deck and complete an encounter there; then, you immediately proceed on to the next card in the adventure deck, until you hit an "objective" card. These cards represent tougher monsters, but once you defeat one, you've completed the adventure.
