# Zer Game Wot Will Be Like Warhammer Quest But Not Really

## Systems

There's got to be a story system, an encounter system, a combat system, a stuff system, and a character system.

### Stuff System

The easiest? of these is the stuff system. There are item decks that are keyed to particular levels. So there's a level 1 deck, a level 2 deck, and a level 3 deck (say). Those decks are based around the encounters, which will be similarly leveled.

You'll have items, weapons, armor, and so on, and these will all be shuffled together and dispensed as loot according to the level of encounter.


### Story system

Stories are generated from a deck of story things. So you'd have a random selection of story "scenes". The stories could be linear, in which case it'd be much like WQ's dungeon sections, so you'd take a selection of, say 6 scenes, then another of 5 + an "ending" card, shuffle the 6 on top and then the 5 + ending to the bottom.

Maybe more interesting, though, would be to have certain quest cards which would have objectives, and you'd go through the scene cards having encounters until you'd assembled all of the things required for the quest.

I'm not sure if there should be multiple paths? Maybe even something a little like L5R's dynasty slots (or Waterdeep's quest piles)—so you'd have x number of options being recharged from the same deck as you complete them.


### Encounter system

Encounters are basically anything that could advance the plot or give you stuff you could use to complete it. (This includes combat, but that'll be a more complex system.)

An encounter could be a trap, or it could be bribing a politician, or it could be navigating a forest (ideally). But in general, whatever it is, it just involves passing a skill check or two. When the encounter is passed, the party keeps the encounter card; these will be used eventually to complete the quest.

Encounters should maybe have multiple ways to resolve them? Different ways of resolving them might give different rewards.


### Combat system

I'm thinking something like Final Fantasy—party vs enemies, turn based—but I'm not real sure here.


### Character system

Some basic stats (combat, magic, wits)?, with numbers, special abilities by classes. You'll also have certain abilities from an abilities deck.


## Some examples

Ok, so if we go with this idea, you'll have a quest. Let's say it's "Rescue the Princess". Resolving the quest requires ("Tracking x2" or "Informant") then ("Entry" and "Valor x3") or ("Contacts" and "Favor").

You've got the following scenes available:

The Inn, The Arena, The Court, The Woods

Here's what these cards would look like:

- The Inn: Valor, Contacts, Informant
- The Arena: Valor, Contacts, Training
- The Court: Favor, Contacts, Informant
- The Woods: Tracking, Hunting, Stealth

If the party wants an Informant encounter, for example, they could go to either the Inn or the Court and draw an Informant encounter from the deck.

We'll say the adventurer goes to the Inn. They draw an Informant encounter: it's "Straight Bribery", which requires a Wits check. If the character passes it, they keep the Straight Bribery card, which counts as an Informant, so they get to pass on to the next phase of the quest and start seeking Entry and Valor or Contacts and Favor. If not, they lose the encounter and must keep looking for Tracking or Informant. (They can also decline to attempt the encounter.)

Either way, the Inn scene has been used and is and replaced by another story scene from the deck.
